# Boardime :game_die:
BGGApp is a simple search-engine which can help you choose game based on the time you have and amount of players. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and built using GitHub Pages.

## General info
This app was made for two purposes: 
1. To practice my code skills in React and API
2. To help players with the most urgent problem: WHAT CAN I PUT ON MY TABLE AND PLAY. It's using info about your game collection and number of plays from your BoardGameGeek account.

## Technologies
* **React** in version: 16.6.0
* **BGG API** (link: *https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2*)

## Demo 
You can find demo version here:
https://boardime.herokuapp.com/

## How to
To check how this app works you can type my own login from my BGG account: nicolaskim. Next pass the time (in minutes!) and number of players. I recommend to type 100 for time, and 3 for number of players. It will show results.


## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

Ready:
* Listing games from your collection based on the time and amount of players
* Showing how many times you played each of the title
* Adding play time of checked game to show total time of chosen games.
* Listing only played or not played games (so you can always choose if you have extra time for learn new rules)
* Randomly choosing one game 

To-do:
* Sort games based on the play date

## Status
Project is: in progress.
